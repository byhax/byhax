- [ ] production deployment
- [ ] port/add to other community
- [ ] identify futher needs of actual users (both members, and back-office functionality), and expand roadmap

# Design choices

- use single design across platform, follow material-design guidelines
- model data entities after schema.org and dublin-core, where it makes sense
- build as simple web-app, but use `react-native-web`, such that it is easy to port to actual app later.
- `pouchdb` for sync/offline state, mirror relevant parts into `immutable` `redux` state
    - database per community, and per user
- unit testing and coverage
- reduce number of dependencies
- code formatting: prettier

## Design of redux state

Synced to two pouchdbs: `community`(sync'ed with server) and `user`

- `events` (sync'ed to community-pouch, modelled after schema.org/Event)

    - keywords (not on events, but typical naming in schema/dc).
- `ui` ephemeral state, not synced
- `user` (synced to user-pouch)
    - `me` modelled after schema.org/Person
    - `byhaxAppSettings`
